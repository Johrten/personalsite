        <p class="clean-font">I recently graduated from the Flatiron School's 15-week full-stack development course.
                                            While attending the program, I used Ruby (on Rails), pure Javascript, and React.js to build
                                            a variety of programs that took advantage of RESTful APIs. Additionally, I taught myself
                                            how to use WebSockets and learned recently released tools such as React Context API.</p>
        <p class="clean-font">Prior to my time at Flatiron, I was the Spa Director at Gentle Healing Wellness Spa. I was
                                            responsible for all day-to-day operations of the business, including staff management,
                                            marketing initiatives, and print/online design. </p>
        <p class="clean-font">In Spring of 2016, I graduated from New York University's Gallatin School in three years
                                            with a Bachelor of Arts in Content Creation and Marketing. Additionally, I received a minor
                                            in the business of entertainment, media and technology. By taking classes over summer
                                            and winter breaks, I received my diploma a full year ahead of schedule. Some of the
                                            classes I took were "Production and Publication," “Media Ethics & First Amendment Law”
